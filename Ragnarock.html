            <h3>The world serpent lays at the bottom of the ocean and he got tired of lying in the ocean during the cold winters so when the world serpent started moving it caused earthquakes that caused the imprisoned loki and fenris wolf to be free so the three of them set out to asgard seeking blood because the gods didn't do anything about the temperature of the ocean and loki and fenris wolf were just seeking blood because they were imprisoned for so long  They eventually kill almost all of the gods some of them being Odin, Thor, Loki, Heimdall, Vidar,  Tyr, Freyr. Every god meets their end in ragnarok, its unavoidable.</h3>
